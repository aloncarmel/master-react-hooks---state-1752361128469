          - text: Now, let's jump into the ocean of side effects with the useEffect hook. If
              the phrase 'side effect' conjures images of medication warnings,
              fear not! In React, it means anything that affects something

          - text: UseEffect is the tool you need for handling side effects like data
              fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. Think of it
              as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount
              all rolled into one neat, reusable package.
          - text: By using it wisely, you make your components cleaner and more predictable
              than a crystal ball. Want a deeper dive? Here's more on [Using the
