              hook return?

      name: quiz
      params:
        person: lucca

trigger:
  type: chat_form_submitted
  flowNode:
    switch:
      key: ${formSubmission}
      cases:
        A:
          do:
            - actionId: bot_message
              params:
                person: lucca
                messages:
                  - text: Correctamundo! useState returns an array containing the current state and
                      a function to update it. Nicely done!
            - actionId: finish_step
        B:
          do:
            - actionId: bot_message
              params:
                person: lucca
                messages:
                  - text: Not quite, though you're close. Remember, useState provides both the state
                      and a way to update it. Give it another whirl!

                  - text: Nope! useState doesnâ€™t return an object, it's all about that array. Try
                      again, please!
