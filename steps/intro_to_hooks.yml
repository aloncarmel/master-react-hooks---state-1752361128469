          - text: Welcome to the world of React Hooks, my eager learner! Hooks were
              introduced in React 16.8, and their purpose is to enable state and
              side-effect management in functional components. Gone are the days
              when only class components had all the fun with state management.
          - text: With hooks, you can now stay functional and also manage your component
              state without writing a class component. It's like giving
              functional components a new superpower! Alongside state
              management, hooks allow us to handle side effects, such as
              fetching data, with the elegance of a functional approach.
          - text: " Intrigued? Good, because hooks epitomize Reactâ€™s philosophy of
              simplicity and reusability. Want to read more? Check out [React
